"""
View for rendering the index page of the web application.

This view displays a search box for finding patient records and allows the user to select one or more records for further processing. The selected records can be downloaded as a PDF document by clicking a button.

Attributes:
    template_name (str): the name of the HTML template to be rendered.

Methods:
    get_context_data(**kwargs): generates the context data dictionary for the template rendering. The method retrieves the search query from the GET parameters and retrieves or generates the relevant data objects from the database. The context data includes the request object, the search query, the list of matching patients, the selected patient (if any), the follow-up and traceability checkboxes, the materials associated with the selected patient (if traceability is checked), and the indices of the selected records (if any).
    get(request, *args, **kwargs): handles GET requests. If the "Generar pdf" button was clicked, the method generates a PDF document based on the selected records and returns it as a response. Otherwise, the method simply renders the template with the context data.

Usage:
    The view is associated with the 'index' URL pattern in the website's URLs file. When a user accesses this URL, the view searches for patients whose names match the search criteria provided in the 'q' parameter of the GET request. The search results are displayed in a table on the index page, along with links to view more detailed information about each patient.
    If the user clicks on the "Generar pdf" button on the page, the view generates a PDF document that includes additional information about the selected patient(s), such as traceability data for the raw materials used in their products, or a detailed record of their medical history. The PDF document is created by combining multiple HTML templates (defined in separate files) using the `download_pdfs` utility function, and then returning the resulting PDF file to the user's browser.
    The view also stores the search criteria in the user's session, so that it can be retrieved and used again if the user navigates away from the index page and then returns to it later.

        Description:
            This method retrieves the search query from the GET parameters and retrieves or generates the relevant data objects from the database. The context data includes the following keys:
            - 'request': the current request object.
            - 'q': the search query, if any.
            - 'patient_list': a list of Patient objects matching the search query, if any.
            - 'selected_patient': the selected Patient object, if any.
            - 'follow-up': a boolean indicating whether the 'follow-up' checkbox was checked.
            - 'traceability': a boolean indicating whether the 'traceability' checkbox was checked.
            - 'materials': a list of Traceability objects associated with the selected Patient, if traceability is checked.
            - 'indices': a list of integers representing the indices of the selected records, if any.

            If no search query is provided, the method returns an empty list of Patient objects.

            If a selected Patient is found, the method populates the 'follow-up' and 'traceability' keys in the context data based on the corresponding GET parameters. If traceability is checked, the method also retrieves the associated Traceability objects from the database.

            The 'indices' key is populated based on the remaining GET parameters, which represent the indices of the selected records.
